/*
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

#Examples:

s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
error_printer(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
error_printer(s) => "8/22"
*/

function printerError(s) {
  let totalChars = s.split("").length;
  let count = 0;
  // important point to note
  // The string contains only letters from ato z.
  // a -> 97 and z -> 122 and m -> 109
  for (let i = 0; i < totalChars; i++) {
    if (s.charCodeAt(i) > 109) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  let output = count + "/" + totalChars;
  return output;
}

// Tests
var s = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmxyyyyyz";
console.log(printerError(s), "7/60");
